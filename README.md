# DogVision

## Introduction
A machine learning project that uses deep learning to classify dog breeds from images.
The model is able to predict 120 dog breeds with over 90% accuracy.
There is a demo folder ready to use for making a Hugging Face live demo.

## Prerequisites
Python
Pytorch
Matplotlib
Tqdm
Gradio

## Usage Guide:
'main.ipynb': Containing all the code for model creation and training.
'classes.txt': An structured file containing the list of all different classes.
'models': All of trained models are stored in this folder.
'runs': This folder is created in order to store Tensorboard logs.
'demo': Contains all is needed to make a live demo using Gradio and Hugging Face.

## Deployment
The model can be deployed and become live using Gradio and Hugging Face.

## Built With
Pytorch - The deep learning framework used
Tensorboard - Tracking and comparing performances of models
Gradio - Used for model deployment
